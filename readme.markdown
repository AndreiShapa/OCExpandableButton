##Intro##

OCExpandableButton is a VERY simple component in native Objective C that mimics the behavior of the expanding menu in the Sparrow mail app.  You give it an array of subviews, and it presents them when it's activated.  It is a normal subview, so you're in charge of rotation, and anything extra.

TODO:

- Implement the alignment setting in the class
- Suggestions?
